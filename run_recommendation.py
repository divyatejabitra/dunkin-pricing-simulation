"""
Run the Pricing Scenario Agent + Recommendation Agent to produce a provisional
pricing recommendation for a hypothetical Dunkin' campus store, from the
verified rows in data/competitor_prices.csv.

This is a hypothesis-generation tool for the 9/24 preliminary market analysis -
NOT a real elasticity estimate. Once survey data lands (after 10/19), this
should be replaced or checked against actual regression results.

Usage:
    python run_recommendation.py
